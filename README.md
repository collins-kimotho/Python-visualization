# Data Visualization Project: Pokemon Dataset
This repository contains a data visualization project using Python, focusing on the analysis of the Pokemon dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project includes three files for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data visualization analysis, respectively.

## Dataset
The Pokemon dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The dataset provides comprehensive information about various Pokemon, including their characteristics, abilities, types, and statistics. The data is available in CSV format and can be found here.

## Project Files
- univariate_visualization.py: This Python script focuses on univariate data visualization analysis. It explores individual variables in the Pokemon dataset, providing insights and visual representations to understand their distributions, frequencies, and relationships.

- bivariate_visualization.py: This file contains the code for bivariate data visualization analysis. It investigates the relationships between pairs of variables in the Pokemon dataset, helping to uncover correlations, associations, and patterns between different characteristics of the Pokemon.

- multivariate_visualization.py: The Python script in this file focuses on multivariate data visualization analysis. It aims to visualize the interactions and dependencies between multiple variables simultaneously, offering a holistic view of the Pokemon dataset and enabling deeper insights into the relationships among various attributes.

## Dependencies
To run the project successfully, you need to ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
You can install the dependencies by executing the following command:

## Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2 Install the required dependencies mentioned above if they are not already installed.
3. Place the Pokemon dataset (CSV file) in the same directory as the project files.
4. Open the desired file (univariate_visualization.py, bivariate_visualization.py, or multivariate_visualization.py) in a Python IDE or text editor.
5. Run the script to visualize the data and observe the generated plots.
